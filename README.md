# EvolutionProject
### Author: Anna ZajÄ…c

Program is presenting a simple visualisation of the evolution process. Given the start number of animals, size of the map and the ratio of the jungle, program randomly generates movement of the animals and their behaviours. Every animal has start amount of energy, which it use  every time it move or breed. When the energy goes down to zero, animal dies. You can observe, how number of animals on the map is changing periodically: when there is too much animals, they do not have enough food to survive, but then, when the plants will grown again, the population is increasing.
